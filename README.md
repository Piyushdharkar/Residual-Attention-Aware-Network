The dataset can also be loaded through the keras library.

You can run the notebook on Google Colab or your local machine. In case of Colab, please change the model directory path to your preferred directory path on your Google Drive. In case of a local machine, please save the model directly to a folder on your machine, instead of using the drive library.
